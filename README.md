# bashrc
My custom bashrc crafted on ubuntu 16.04

Not much exciting here. This is my custom bashrc. The most important thing (to me) is that the history is saved automatically on every command execution. So many times I have ssh sessions that end hung and the history never gets saved on the remote server. The second most important thing is the git customizations and the fact that I get a prompt indicator when there are uncommited changes.

There will be a update script to copy ~/.bashrc and strip any passwords out into the src dir and a load script to copy the src bashrc over the current one.
